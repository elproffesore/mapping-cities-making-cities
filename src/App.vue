                        According to famous Thomas Theorem, formulated by by William and Dorothy Thomas in 1928, we can
                        point out, that the interpretation of a situation (however "objectively" false it may appear)
                        has real consequences because the actions of actors are based on their definition of the
                        situation. In other words, the interpretation of a situation causes the action. This
                        interpretation is not objective. Actions are affected by subjective perceptions of situations.
                        Whether there even is an objectively correct interpretation is not important for the purposes of
                        helping guide individuals' behavior.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        People that show the feeling of crisis are especially more extreme in the estimation of their
                        current situation. A hightened sense of anxiety can hinder curiosity and strengthen the tendency
                        to stick to our own beliefs; it can make us prone to extreme positions which provide a clear
                        interpretation of our multi faceted and ever changing reality.

                            crises
                            perception is,

                        Although crises lead on different spectrums of society to distrust on governmental institutions
                        and political parties, people still express their political position in demonstrations, no
                        matter the level of crisis, socioeconomic or demographic background. On the other hand, levels
                        of trust have been eroding no matter the political position or the feeling of crisis. On the
                        contrasting side to the referred feelings of crisis, anger and concern lays the feeling of
                        Self-Efficacy. Â»The traditional, hierarchical government model simply does not meet the demands
                        of this complex, rapidly changing age. [...] thriving in the net worked age requires governments
                        to change the way they think and operate. [...] we need to update our thinking.Â« (Eggers: Â»The
                        changing nature of governmentÂ«, S. 28)

                        In the future, more diffused approaches to governance in all parts of society will only work if
                        there are frameworks in place that assure very high levels of transpar-
                        ency, accountability and integrity. At the same time, for public authorities and
                        society more broadly, the ability to put new forms of governance into the service
                        of realising peopleâs collective good will depend on a common commitment to
                        democratic values, human rights and equality of opportunity. Even with these
                        frameworks and values in place, the emergence of new forms of governance will
                        still depend fundamentally on the capacity of individuals and groups to partici-
                        pate actively in making and implementing decisions.
